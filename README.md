# Project Teleword
This is my first coding project. Its a game called teleword.
This game requires a text file containing a 2-D matrix of specific characters and a list of words. The game allows user to see the words by highlighting the characters one word at a time. The characters left at the end represent a word themselves which is called "Teleword". The code is in C++ and has basic console view.
